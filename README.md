## Task: ##
Change ntp to ntp.se with Ansible in an RHEL 8 virtual server named ntp.edu.tentixo.com via VagrantBox on VirtualBox - connection should be done with computer name, not IP.

## Description: ##
This project was created as part of the "[DevSecOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops)" course. The project uses tools such as as [Vagtant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs) (is a tool for building and distributing development environments.), [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) (is a software tool that provides simple but powerful automation for cross-platform computer support) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Documentation)(is a cross-platform virtualization application).The goal of the project is to change the ntp settings using the above-described tools on a remote host is that observing the conditionality of the task.

## Benefit: ##
This project solves the problem of manually creating a virtual machine and manually configuring ntp on a remote host.
